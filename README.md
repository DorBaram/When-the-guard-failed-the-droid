###   how to use perm_ext.py
####   for now, you need to open the csv file that 'fix' made and change:
    1.  change the second column name to 'name'
    2.  add labels to the 'tag' column (0/1)(benign or malware)
    3.  add labels to the 'category' column (0/1/2/3)(train/test)

# Dataset
As our malicious dataset is private, we can't attach it to our github. The benign apps can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/126Y5mbgHEAQdqXRwrom-UT2R9mgT_VQS?usp=sharing

# Source code
We uploaded the code for our attacks and for the functionality and maliciousness tests. We also uploaded two classifiers we used - Kirin and PB_AMD. For Drebin, visit https://github.com/MLDroid/drebin. The FAMOUS classifier's code is private. Therefore, we could not add its code.
